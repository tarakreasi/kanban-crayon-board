## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### "Crayon Focus" Aesthetic

The interface follows the **Crayon Focus** design language:

1. **Playful yet Professional**: Vibrant colors balanced with clean layouts
2. **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects create depth and hierarchy
3. **Motion-Rich**: Smooth animations that enhance (not distract from) productivity
4. **Dark-Mode First**: Both themes are first-class citizens
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant color contrasts

### Color System
- **Light Mode**: Indigo-purple-pink gradient with soft pastels
- **Dark Mode**: Rich navy palette with subtle color tints
- **Dynamic Theming**: Board colors influence the entire UI
